		<section class="m-3 p-2">I loved puzzles since preschool. In fact I enjoyed it so much my teacher, Mrs. Sharon, came up with a certificate. In hindsight, it was a bit odd. Preschool was just the beginning of my passion for puzzles, as the years went on I solved any puzzle I could get my hands on. At one point these puzzles became decorative pieces around the house. Who needed a painting by Thomas Kinkade when you could just make a puzzle of it? What exactly was so fascinating to me about puzzles? There was an art to making them, there was strategy on how to go about making them and the more I practiced the better I got. My favorite part? There is a moment, it's very brief when you lock in that last piece that you are filled with satisfaction and pride of a job well done. Whether that puzzle was 100 piece or 5000 the feeling is the same.</section>
		<section class="m-3 p-2">Around my teenage years I got away from putting together puzzle pieces and instead focused on another puzzle: wrestling. There was an award I watched a senior receive as a freshman that was awarded to the senior that best exemplified leadership and commitment to the team. For those of you that have never wrestled before, practices are not easy. You're practicing for hours at a time in what is essentially a sauna. I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider quitting more than once. As I watched the award being given that day I wonder how that senior must have felt getting that award. I would find out 4 years later. And I'll never forget that feeling, I didn't think of all the grueling practices, dehydrated & starving from cutting weight or all the runs up Morrison Canyon; none of it mattered. In that momement I was just filled with appreciation. </section>
		<section class="m-3 p-2">After graduating from University of California Davis I decided to take a year before applying to medical school. It was during this time I started doing some Codecademy courses between breaks of studying for the MCAT. I found myself hooked on these courses. It was a feeling that I had felt before; albeit it had been many years. It was the same feeling when I would complete a puzzle or win a wrestling match except now instead of putting together puzzle pieces or practicing my wrestling technique I was writing lines of code to build applications.</section>
