<p id="1">I loved puzzles since preschool. In fact I enjoyed it so much my teacher, Mrs. Sharon, came up with a certificate. I never understoof why, perhaps she knew something then that I didn't. Preschool was just the beginning of my passion for puzzles, as the years went on I solved any puzzle I could get my hands on. At one point these puzzles became decorative pieces around my house. Who needed a painting by Thomas Kinkade when you could just make a puzzle of it? What exactly was so fascinating to me about puzzles? There was an art to making them, there was strategy on how to go about making them and the more I practiced the better I got. And the best part? There is a moment, its very brief when you lock in that last piece that you are filled with satisfaction and pride of a job well done. Whether that puzzle was 100 piece or 5000 the feeling is the same.</p>
<p id="2">Around my teenage years I got away from putting together puzzle pieces and instead focused on another puzzle: wrestling. There was an award I watch a senior receive as a freshman that was awarded to the senior that best exemplified leadership and commitment to the team. For those of you that have never wrestled before, practices are not easy. You are practicing for hours at a time in what is essentially a sauna. I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider quitting more than once. I wondered that day how that senior must have felt getting that award after 4 years in the wrestling program. I would find out 4 years later. As I received the Coaches award; I didn't think of all the grueling practices, dehydrated & starving from cutting weight or all the runs up Morrison Canyon; none of it matter. In that momement I was just filled with appreciation. </p>
<p id="3">After graduating from University of California Davis I decided to take a year before applying to medical school. It was during this time I started doing some CodeCademy courses between breaks of studying for the MCAT. I found myself hooked on these courses. It was a feeling that I had felt before; albeit it had been many years. It was the same feeling when I would complete a puzzle or win a wrestling match except now instead of putting together puzzle pieces or practicing my wrestling technique I was writing lines of code to build applications. </p>
<p id="4">Two weeks before I took the admissions test to medical school I was at a crossroads. Yes, I'd committed to medical school by completing a bachelors in Exercise Biology. Yes, my bachelors was no CS degree. Yes, I'd be at an disadvantage and I'd have to work harder than I had ever before to get started in this industry. None of it mattered; without a doubt this was the easiest decision I'd ever made. I hope one day I'll run into Mrs. Sharon and thank her for that certificate.</p>
